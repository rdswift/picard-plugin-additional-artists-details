# Additional Artists Details

This plugin provides specialized album and track variables with artist details such as type, gender, begin and end dates, location (begin, end and current) and country code (begin, end and current) for use in tagging and naming scripts.

***NOTE:*** This plugin makes additional calls to the MusicBrainz website api for the information, which will slow down retrieving album information from MusicBrainz.  This will be particularly noticable when there are many different album or track artists, such as on a \[Various Artists\] release.  There is an option to disable track artist processing, which can significantly increase the processing speed if you are only interested in album artist details.

Please see the [User Guide](https://picard-plugins-user-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_artists_details/user_guide.html) for more information, including usage examples.
